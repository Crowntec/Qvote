## üßæ CSV Upload Format for Admins

Admin should upload a `.csv` with the following format:

```csv
FullName,Email,PhoneNumber
Jane Doe,jane.doe@email.com,+1234567890
John Smith,john.smith@email.com,+1987654321
Amina Yusuf,amina.yusuf@email.com,+1122334455
```

- System will auto-generate unique Voter ID and secure PIN for each voter.
- Voter ID and PIN should be securely shared with voters via email or SMS.

---

## üîí Security Note

- Vote tokens are generated using Q# (quantum randomness).
- Tokens are one-time use and not stored permanently.
- Voter‚Äôs ability to vote is tracked by `HasVoted` status.
